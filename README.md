# AutoClickerOrganic
An Autoclicker using only modules from the standard python library for systems that don't have external libraries. USE RESPONSIBLY WITH GOOD INTENTION AND ONLY FOR THINGS SUCH AS COOKIE CLICKERS.

As mentioned previously, although the auto clicker can not cause harm to a system, still use responsibly and with good intention. Use for things such as CPS test or cookie clickers. 

Uses NO external libraries so can be used at school or work computers for some cookie-clicking fun!

No stop/start mechanism after time started due to limitations of default python library, so use alt+f4 when necessary to quit the program
