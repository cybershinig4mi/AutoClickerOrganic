# AutoClickerOrganic
An Autoclicker using only modules from the standard python library for systems that don't have external libraries. USE RESPONSIBLY WITH GOOD INTENTION AND ONLY FOR THINGS SUCH AS COOKIE CLICKERS.

As mentioned previously, although the auto clicker can not cause harm to a system, still use responsibly and with good intention. Use for things such as CPS test or cookie clickers. 

There are several different versions of the clicker to see which one suits you, although they are limited to the constraints of the standard python library.

Several of them have no stop/start mechanism and those that do are unreliable, so use alt+f4 when necessary to quit the program
